This is the monorepo containing our custom mods for MineClone2.

# ðŸš¨ NPM WORKAROUND ðŸš¨

Due to a issue in Minetest, we have to use a workaround to get NPM to work. An empty `init.lua` is placed in the `node_modules/` folder, but be sure to still `npm install`.

Issue: https://github.com/minetest/minetest/issues/11240#issuecomment-1636181699

# Installation

Clone this repo into the `/worldmods/` directory of a world you want to have it in (or into the `/mods/` directory of a game you want to have it in).
The preferred method of installation is the `worldmods` method because it doesn't require you to manually enable the mods in the Minetest configuration screen.
